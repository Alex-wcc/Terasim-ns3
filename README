TeraSim is the first simulation platform for THz communication networks which captures the capabilities of THz devices and the peculiarities of the THz channel, it implements recently proposed MAC and PHY layer solutions tailored to both nanoscale and macroscale THz scenarios. More specifically, in terms of channel, we have developed a common channel module that implements the frequency selective channel model. At the PHY and MAC layers, two parallel set of modules for nanoscale and macroscale scenarios have been developed. In relation to the capabilities of THz devices, we have implemented an energy harvesting model and a THz directional antenna model. We have thoroughly validated the functionalities of the models by comparing the simulation outputs to the analytical and numerical results available in the literature.
